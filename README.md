Mine and Blade : Battlegear - 2
===============================
	
Minecraft version: 1.11.2
Forge Version: 1.11.2-13.20.0.2228

This is the second iteration of Mine & Blade: Battlegear, the popular dual-wielding and combat mod for Minecraft.
The mod has a heavy dependency on the use of ASM (coremod) to edit the bytecode of the minecraft base classes. 

What works
----------
* Dual wielding of weapons and fists
* Switching between normal and battlemode with the 'R' Key
* Attacking entities with both the offhand and mainhand weapons
* Rendering of dual wielding in 1st person view
* 3rd person rendering (with sheaths)
* Swinging of offhand items of other players
* Rendering of offhand weapons on other players
* Shift Clicking on the inventory screen
* The Following (enchantable) Weapons
    + Waraxe
    + Mace
    + Spear
    + Dagger
* Shields
    + Shield Blocking
    + Shield Bash
    + Arrows being stuck in Shields
    + Enchantments
* Quivers
* Arrows

**Note from nerd-boy:** I am not 100% happy with the way we are syncing items. It works now by sending a packet with all the "battle items" to each player that is viewing a player every second.
I am not sure if this will be too much or not. Although right now I cannot think of another way to do it that doesn't require more bytecode manipulation. I think we already have enough AccessTransformers planed to keep us busy without adding more that we may in fact not need.

What doesn't work
-----------------
* Heraldry (greater customization for shields, quivers, armors)

Installation
------------
**To make a fork**
The files contained within the repository must be placed inside a minecraft forge-universal src installation.
Due to potential legal issues of re-distributing Mojang .java files, all base class edits are distributed as .java.patch files. They serve only as documentation.
You can set a dev environment by Gradle, with IntelliJIdea:
`` gradlew setupDecompWorkspace idea genIntellijRuns``
or Eclipse:
`` gradlew setupDecompWorkspace eclipse``
then import the project file.
Complete the running configurations with the VM option:
`` -Dfml.coreMods.load=mods.battlegear2.coremod.BattlegearLoadingPlugin``

**To make an addon**
The files in /battlegear api folder can be used as external libraries.
M.U.D and Battlegear are independent.
To load them while making the addon, simply put them in the /mods folder in your mod run installation.

Depending on the version of ForgeGradle, you may need to add -noCoreSearch as run configuration argument to avoid duplicated patching.

Compiling the Mod
-----------------
The mod can be compiled using the following gradle command
``gradlew build``

This will generate a jar file in the battlegear dist folder, along with its checksum.

Some Notes for Texture Pack Makers
----------------------------------

Some of the rendering capabilities of the mod are still in development, especially concerning the heraldry. The following are a few notes.
* The patterns should only have white. The white section will determine the secondary colour. The primary colour will be the alpha section. Semi transparent sections should also work for better blending.
* The icons should be greyscale and alpha values. They also require at least 1 pixal border around the whole image that should be kept black. This is the reason all of them are 18x18 pixals (16x16 plus a 1px border all around)
